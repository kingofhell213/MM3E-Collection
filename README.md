# Mutants and Masterminds 3rd Edition Collection
A collection of compendiums for Mutants and Masterminds 3rd Edition for advantages, power profile powers, gadget guide devices/equipment, equipment, vehicles, and headquarters/installations to assist in character creation!

WARNING
As of the time of this upload Modifiers on Advantages are currently broken on the Mutants and Masterminds sheets. In order to fix it, after adding the Advantage to your character sheet, click the Edit button on the advantage, then go to the Modifiers tab. Enable Edit Modifiers, and then on the far right drop down menus you must change whatever it's set to, to Simple Modifier and then change it back to what it was previously. This will fix it and make it reflect properly on your character sheet.
